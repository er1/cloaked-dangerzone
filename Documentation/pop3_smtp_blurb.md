## Protocols used

We have elected to use standard protocols for our email client. Our original design decision to make all our messages rfc822 and rfc2822 compliant allowed us to use protocols that depended on these standards such as POP3 and SMTP. We use SMTP as our means of sending messages to a compliant server and we expect messages in the mailbox on a potentially different server with POP3. This allows us to use our client with other internet servers. Due to the short amount of time we had, we did not implement connection encryption and as such we had to use a custom configured server. We deployed our server on a virtual machine running Ubuntu Lucid with the stock mail servers Postfix for SMTP and Dovecot for POP3. Postfix was configured only to allow local unencrypted mail (so the SSL requirement was removed) and Dovecot was configured to allow plain-text passwords on unencrypted links. Given that these are only encryption requirements. Our architechture allows us to drop in a secure socket (or any other socket that may potentially use these protocols) in place of the standard unencrypted socket. If a secure socket were implemented, this implementation would then work with real world servers such as gmail, live mail, and other common mail providers.
